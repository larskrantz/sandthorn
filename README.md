# Sandthorn Event Sourcing
A ruby framework for saving an object's state as a series of events, and tracking non state changing events.

## What is Event Sourcing

"Capture all changes to an application state as a sequence of events."
[Event Sourcing](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html)

## The short story

Think of it as an object database where you not only what the new value of the attribute is but when and why it changed.
_Example:_

```ruby

# Setup the Aggregate

# The one available right now
require 'sandthorn'
require 'sandthorn_driver_sequel'

class Ship
  include Sandthorn::AggregateRoot
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize name: nil, shipping_company: nil
    @name = name
  end

  # State-changing command
  def rename! new_name: ""
    unless new_name.empty? or new_name == name
      @name = new_name
      ship_was_renamed
    end
  end

  private

  # Commit the event and state-change is automatically recorded.
  def ship_was_renamed
    commit
  end
end

# Setup the framework with the sequel driver for persistance
url = "sqlite://spec/db/sequel_driver.sqlite3"
catch_all_config = [ { driver: SandthornDriverSequel.driver_from_url(url: url) } ]
Sandthorn.configuration = catch_all_config

# Migrate db schema for the sequel driver
migrator = SandthornDriverSequel::Migration.new url: url
SandthornDriverSequel.migrate_db url: url

# Usage
ship = Ship.new name: "Titanic"
ship.rename! new_name: "Vasa"

ship.save

new_ship = Ship.find ship.id
puts new_ship.name

# For more info look at the specs.

```
